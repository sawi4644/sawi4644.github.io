<h1> Sara Wilson Home Directory </h1>

<h2> What's behind the scenes? </h2>
<p> For the main page of my home website I wanted to create a fun, clean, and interactive webpage. From this main page I implemented multiple different languages, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and CSS Bootstrap. I used these languages to give the user an authentic experience to my website that engages them with who I am.</p>

<h2> Mood Board </h2>
<p> For my website I wanted to have an overarching theme between my contact page, my portfolio page, and my main home screen. As projects differenciate when show cased, I envisioned my theme to stay as consistent as possible. </p>
