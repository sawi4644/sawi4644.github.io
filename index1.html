    <h1 class='title'>Sara Wilson - Web Developer</h1>
    <div class='education'>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Recent Certification from Northwestern University in Web Development. Attended 6 month boot camp. I also have
            recieved a bachelor's degree in advertising with a minor in technology, arts, and media
            from the University of Colorado Boulder. </p>

        <h2>What makes me unique?</h2>
        <p>The combination of my passions and my personailty play the biggest factors in answering this question. The
            experience and knowledge of technology, code, and digital media all come together in one cohesive creative
            harmony. I find excitment knowing there are ways I can be a triple threat. </p>

        <p>Some of these cohesive understandings for example are the way a consumer thinks, and then being able to study
            their shopping or online patterns, create a consumer pathway and then actually assist in the development of
            the product that will either assist in a companies business endevours or be the final product that excites a
            consumer. </p>
        <p>
            Not only do I feel like I can get inside the head of a consumer and appeal to them both visually and
            methodically. I also have my background in Account Management. I can play a strong role in being a
            trustworthy liason between the client and the development team. I have exerpience in making timelines and
            ensuring those projects meet the deadlines that are necessaary.
        </p>
        <p>
            I could go on forever... check out my portfolio and resume. Please feel free to connect, let's build
            something together.
